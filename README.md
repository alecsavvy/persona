# persona

"the aspect of someone's character that is presented to or perceived by others."

Persona is intended to be a decentralized progression to the identity service currently run for Audius. Potentially introduced as a third node type. Currently this server will forward requests to the relevant identity instance on the environment it's configured for so features and routes can be distributed and replaced over time.
